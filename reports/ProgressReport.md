# Progress Report
## Spoken Reading Comprehension Evaluation using ASR + Semantic Similarity

## Overview

This project builds a pipeline that automatically evaluates short spoken answers to reading comprehension questions, using automatic speech recognition (Whisper) and semantic similarity (Sentence-BERT) instead of rigid exact-match grading. Work is organized into 8 phases and 22 tasks; this report covers progress through **Phase 2 (Dataset)**.

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 1 — Project Setup

**Task 1 — Create Project**
- Initialized a Git repository and Python virtual environment.
- Installed core dependencies: `faster-whisper`, `sentence-transformers`, `torch` (CPU), `scikit-learn`, `numpy`, `pandas`.
- Verified all imports run correctly.
- Resolved a package-installation issue caused by the project directory being OneDrive-synced (fixed by using `python -m pip` to ensure installs targeted the correct environment).
- Cleaned and pushed the initial commit to GitHub after correcting an early mistake where large PyTorch binaries were accidentally committed before `.gitignore` existed.

**Task 2 — Organize Project Structure**
- Created the project's folder structure: `data/`, `models/`, `notebooks/`, `src/`, `evaluation/`, `demo/`, `reports/`.
- Added `.gitkeep` placeholder files so empty folders are tracked by Git (Git does not track empty directories by default).
- Configured `.gitignore` to exclude `data/` and `models/` from version control, since these will contain large datasets and model weights that don't belong in Git history.

### Phase 2 — Dataset

**Task 3 — Download and Explore Dataset**
- Downloaded the SQuAD v1.1 dataset (train and dev splits) as raw JSON files, choosing direct download over a helper library in order to understand the data format firsthand.
- Explored and mapped the nested JSON structure:
  - File → list of **articles** → each article has a `title` and a list of **paragraphs**
  - Each paragraph has `context` (the passage text) and `qas` (question–answer pairs)
  - Each `qa` has a `question`, an `id`, and an `answers` list, where each answer includes both the answer `text` and its character position (`answer_start`) in the passage
- Understood the purpose of `answer_start`: it disambiguates *which occurrence* of a repeated phrase in the passage is the correct answer, rather than indicating grading leniency.
- Saved exploration work as a Jupyter notebook (`notebooks/01_explore_squad.ipynb`) and committed it to the repository.

## Next Steps

- **Task 4** — Build `load_dataset.py` to programmatically extract passage/question/answer triples from the JSON and save them as a CSV.
- **Task 5** — Construct a small (~50 question) evaluation subset with reference answers for later testing.
- **Phase 3** onward — Integrate Whisper for speech recognition on spoken answers.

## Working Method

Progress is tracked against a 22-task checklist, worked one task per session (~60 minutes each), with short breaks between sessions to maintain steady, sustainable progress.
